## üèÜ Notable Achievements & Projects @ TikTok, WSAudiology, Start Coding):

**1.** Optimized distributed workers in Go by implementing async I/O, goroutine pooling, and context-based cancellation. This redesign improved throughput by 3.5√ó, cut P99 latency by 65%, and eliminated service timeouts across critical workloads handling 1M+ QPS, ensuring consistent reliability across production services.

**2.** Built an AI-driven component playground that enabled Product Managers to prototype internal components via natural-language prompts. Backed by Golang APIs and knowledge-base slicing for efficient retrieval, the platform was adopted by 25+ PMs across 4 teams, reducing prototyping cycles by 80% and saving the company an estimated $500K annually.

**3.** Designed a distributed RabbitMQ messaging system capable of ingesting and processing 500K+ daily device tests with fault tolerance, consumer load balancing, and real-time monitoring. This increased system uptime to 98.7%, eliminated bottlenecks during peak hours, and provided clear visibility into message flows across services.

**4.** Architected a real-time virtual classroom platform using React, WebRTC, and Socket.IO to support live video conferencing and screen sharing. By building custom React hooks for peer-to-peer connections and integrating Redis-based background jobs, the system achieved <200ms average latency, supporting 100+ concurrent classrooms with reliable streaming quality.
